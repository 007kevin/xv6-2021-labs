* Notes
- VM Implementation
  - Address spaces consists of VMAs and page tables
    - VMA (virtual memory area)
        - contiguous range of virtual addresses
        - same permissions
        - backed by the same object (file, anonymous memory)
    - VMA helps the kernel to decide how to handle page faults
